# Outcomes Job-Tracker
https://outcomes-job-tracker.herokuapp.com/
<h1> Concept:
<h3> After leaving General Assembly, searching for a job will be the next step.  This app allows you to track the jobs you have applied, the networks and
<h3> you have made along the way, and also any future target companies you might have your eyes on to apply to in the future.
<h1> Technologies Used:
<h3> React Router
<h3> Express
<h3> MongoDB
<h3> Heroku

<h1>Approach:
<h3> I wanted to make something simple and easy to use. Practical and not confusing.  

<h1>Development Plan
<h3> Figure out how to make the three different pages be seperate from eachother.
<h3> Make sure the routes worked. 
<h3>Learn flexbox in a few days to be able to employ it properly in my App

<h1>MVP
<h3> React Router
<h3> 3 different Models


<h1>Stretch Goals
<h3> I HAD to learn more flexbox in order to make this functional.
<h3> I want to add more to this. Make it look better and neater and more useful

<h1>Challenges
<h3> Syntax, Syntax, Syntax.... Way too many small errors stopped me from getting ahead in a timely manner. If I had slowed down my typing and paid more attention to what I was trying to do, I could have possibly saved myself over five hours of troubleshooting.
